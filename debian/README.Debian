msmtp-scripts as a Mail Transport Agent
=======================================

It is possible to use msmtpq-ng as a MTA (like postfix, exim, etc.) by installing
the package msmtpq-ng-mta. It will provide the basic features required to be a MTA
(/usr/{sbin,lib}/sendmail, newaliases, etc.).

The msmtpq-ng-mta package is not (and will never be) full featured MTA.

Package is heavily modified, but based on, msmtp packaging from Ubuntu.
